This project implements a Streamlit-based machine learning application using Meta’s Prophet model to forecast housing prices along the East Coast of the United States. It analyzes historical home value trends, incorporating the impact of significant national and international conflicts on the market. While the model provides valuable insights, it acknowledges inherent uncertainties and limitations, including unpredictable “black swan” events and behavioral factors that can affect real estate prices.

The interactive tool visualizes projected home values with options to explore average mortgage interest rates and price fluctuations associated with key geopolitical events. This enables users to better understand how conflicts and economic variables historically influenced the housing market and how they may shape future trends.
